Description: A package to encapsulate a number of balanced sampling algorithms, namely, 
    BAS (equal, unequal, seed point, panels), Halton frames (for discretizing a 
    continuous resource), HIP (equal probability), Spatial balance measures (Voronoi
    and Modified Moranâ€™s I), Variance estimators (local mean, nearest neighbour and
    quasi bootstrap), DAS and the Spatial stratification algorithm.
